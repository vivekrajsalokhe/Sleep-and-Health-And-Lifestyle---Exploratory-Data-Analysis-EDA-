# Sleep-and-Health-And-Lifestyle---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Sleep_And_Health_And_Lifestyle.csv dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to sleep habits and their impact on health.
Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is Sleep_And_Health.csv. It contains various indicators relevant to assessing the relationship between sleep patterns and health outcomes across different populations.

# Steps in the Analysis

1. Data Import & Loading

-- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

-- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Initial Exploration

-- Display the first few rows.

-- Check the data structure (.info()).

-- Check for duplicate values.

-- Summary statistics of numerical columns (.describe()).

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (if applicable)

-- Handling missing values.

-- Removing or modifying duplicates.

Data type conversions.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-- Distribution of sleep duration and health indicators.

-- Correlation between different variables.

Identifying outliers.

-- Visualizations using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

5. Key Insights & Conclusions

-- Summary of major findings from the analysis.

-- Potential recommendations based on observed trends.

# Requirements

-- Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

-- Run the Jupyter Notebook (Sleep_And_Health.ipynb) in a suitable environment such as Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

jupyter notebook Sleep_And_Health.ipynb
